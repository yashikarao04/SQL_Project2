SQL Project: World Layoffs (2020â€“2023)

Welcome to my SQL project analyzing global layoffs from 2020 to 2023. The project focuses on understanding trends in layoffs through rigorous data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Project Overview
This project is divided into two key parts:

Data Cleaning
Ensuring the dataset is clean and reliable by performing the following steps:

1. Remove Duplicates: Eliminated duplicate records to maintain data accuracy.
2. Standardize the Data: Applied consistent formatting across columns to improve clarity.
3. Handle Null and Blank Values: Replaced or removed null and blank entries to ensure data integrity.
4. Remove Unnecessary Columns and Rows: Filtered out irrelevant information to focus on key insights.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted in-depth analyses to uncover patterns and insights regarding global layoffs. This includes identifying trends over time, sector-wise layoffs, and other key metrics.
